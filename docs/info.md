## How it works

The project is a 1-bit half adder. Half adders are used to add 1-bit numbers. We XOR to get the sum and And to get the carry bit.

## How to test

The project can be tested by inputting all combinations of x and y as inputs and seeing if the output matches the theoretical output. This can done using the truth table.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any

None!
